## Component Setup - step by step
**1.** Import and install relevant libraries to your Python project. 
```
pip install st-audio-recorder
```
**2.** Import the function `st_audiorec()` to your main streamlit application code.
```
from streamlit_audio_recorder.st_custom_components import st_audiorec
```
**3.** Add an instance of the audio recorder component to your streamlit app's code.
```
wav_audio_data = st_audiorec()

if wav_audio_data is not None:
    # display audio data as received on the backend
    st.audio(wav_audio_data, format='audio/wav')
    
# INFO: by calling the function an instance of the audio recorder is created
# INFO: once a recording is completed, audio data will be saved to wav_audio_data
```
**4. Enjoy recording audio inside your streamlit app! ðŸŽˆ**
